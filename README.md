# Cryptocopier
### Copyright 2016 - written by Rojo Ambinina

These little codes are just a homemade webscraping algorithm that stores in a text file the top 100 richest cryptocurrencies on https://bitinfocharts.com : Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dashcoin, Reddcoin, Blackcoin ...

To use it, you just have to type in your usual terminal the command below to install the BeautifulSoup and Requests modules. That's all you need.

## pip install beautifulsoup4 requests

Then you just have to go to the folder where the files are, choose the cryptocurrency you want to save, and type its name as the following commands:

py ltccopier.py

py dogecopier.py

py dashcopier.py

py blackcoincopier.py

py reddcoincopier.py
